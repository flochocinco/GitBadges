# GitBadges
Repo to test badges and Automatic Operations

[![Build](https://github.com/flochocinco/GitBadges/actions/workflows/javabuild.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/flochocinco/GitBadges/actions/workflows/javabuild.yml)
[![Unit Test](https://github.com/flochocinco/GitBadges/actions/workflows/default.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/flochocinco/GitBadges/actions/workflows/default.yml)

##What it does
when pushing or pulling:
 - run unit test (see .workflows/default.yml)
 - run build only when pushing a java file

## STATUS
* 2 badges: one for build and one for test. both same xml file but different .yml
* Now I have a badge from "Actions". It seems I don't get last result :( one failed is enough to display the red banner
* At this point I'm only able to run a javac...youpi !
